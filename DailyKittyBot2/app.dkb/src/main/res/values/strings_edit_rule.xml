        A rule contains conditions and outcomes.
        \n\nWhen a rule\'s conditions are satisfied, DKB then transforms its outcomes into recommendations.
        \n\nExample conditions:\n1. When a post links to a certain website, and\n2. DKB has not commented on it before.
        \n\nExample outcome:\n1. Post a particular comment to that post.\n2. Upvote the post.
        \n\nRecommendations are actions that DKB can take for you.
        They are offered to you, and you can choose whether to go ahead with them or not.
